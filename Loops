IF:

if test expression:
    statement(s)
    
if test expression is True then statements are executed. Otherwise not. 
Intendation is a start and non intendetion is the end. 

IF...ELSE:

if test expression:
    Body of if
else:
    Body of else
    
For True if is executed and for False else is executed. 

IF...ElIF...ELSE:

if test expression:
    Body of if
elif test expression:
    Body of elif
else: 
    Body of else
    
    
If True then body executed.
If False then Elif tested, True executed, False goes to else. 
Can have many elif. 

Nesting: 
num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
if num >= 0:
    if num == 0:
        print("Zero")
    else:
        print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")
    
    
if expression
  if expression2
    statement 2
   else: 
  else: 
    statement2
else: 
  statement
  
  
For Loop:

sequences = [1,1,2,4,1] (collection of items in ordered matter, starting from 0)

iterate over characters: 
text = "Niklas"
for character in text: 
    print(character)
    
general:
for item in sequence:
    statement(s)
    
for item in sequence:
    statement
else:
    statement(s)
    
while loop:

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1 (or count += 1)
    
general:
while test_condition (boolean):
    statement while true
    
using range:
for count in range(1,6):
    print(range)
    
    
    
    
    
Break and continue:

for condition:
    statement
    break 
(loop will stop at break)


for condition:
    if condition:
        break
    statement (run if no break and continue)
statement (run if inside loop breaks)
    
    
continue can be used to jump directly to the start again:

for i in range(5):
    number = float(input("please:"))
    if number < 0:
        continue
    print(number)


pass Statement: loop on decision making statement, but unsure what body will be:

number = 5
if number > 0.0:
    pass
    
(not executed, like comment but inside a loop)
