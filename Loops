    else:
        print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Negative number")

For Loop:

iterate over characters:

general:
for item in sequence:
    statement(s)
    
for item in sequence:
    statement
else:

while loop:

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count = count + 1 (or count += 1)
